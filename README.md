# MyIMBD â€“ Modern Movie App

An Android Developer Interview Test Project showcasing a modern, well-architected movie app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## Overview

MyIMBD fetches movie data from a remote source once during the splash screen and caches it locally with Room. After the initial fetch, it runs fully offline. Users can browse movies, search, filter by genre, add to wishlist, and paginate the list in batches of 10.

### Screens:
1. Splash Screen  
2. Movie List Screen  
3. Movie Details Screen  
4. Wishlist Screen
